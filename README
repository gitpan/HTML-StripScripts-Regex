NAME
    HTML::StripScripts::Regex - XSS filter using a regular expression

SYNOPSIS
      use HTML::StripScripts::Regex;

      my $hss = HTML::StripScripts::Regex->new({ Context => 'Inline' });

      $hss->input("<i>hello, world!</i>");

      print $hss->filtered_document;

DESCRIPTION
    This class subclasses HTML::StripScripts, and adds an input method based
    on a regular expression. See HTML::StripScripts.

    Using a regular expression to parse HTML is error prone and inefficient
    for large documents. If HTML::Parser is available then
    HTML::StripScripts::Parser should be used in preference to this module.

METHODS
    This subclass adds the following methods to those of HTML::StripScripts.

    input ( TEXT )
        Parses an HTML document and runs it through the filter. TEXT must be
        the entire HTML document to be filtered, as a single flat string.

SUBCLASSING
    The "HTML::StripScripts::Regex" class is subclassable, in exactly the
    same way as "HMTL::StripScripts". See "SUBCLASSING" in
    HTML::StripScripts for details.
